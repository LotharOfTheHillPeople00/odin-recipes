The Odin Project Recipes Project

This is a project I will attempt to complete using what I've learned so far in the Foundations of HTML portion of the program.
I've created a new repository in GitHub and I've established a remote repo using the terminal.
In this project, I will be creating a very simple website with links to other pages (recipes).
