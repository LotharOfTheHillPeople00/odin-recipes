The Odin Project Recipes Project

This is a project I will attempt to complete using what I've learned so far in the Foundations of HTML portion of the program.
I've created a new repository in GitHub and I've established a link to the files on my local machine.
In this project, I will be creating a very simple website with links to other pages (recipes).
I believe I was successful with this project.
I added links to several pages in an unorder list.
I added images to the recipe pages.
I used both ordered and unordered lists to create the recipes.
While extremely basic, this website demonstrates the HTML skills I've learned so far in TOP.
